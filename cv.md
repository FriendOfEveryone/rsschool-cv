## Briefly story

In 2018, I entered college as a programmer technician. The main programming language was C#.
The secondary programming language was HTML+CSS+JS. In March of last year (2021),
I graduated but for some reason could not continue my studies or work in my specialty.
In February 2022, I tried to go for an internship at Andersen, but did not qualify for reasons unknown to me.
There is no real work experience and portfolio at the moment.
I really want to become a real programmer and get into the team.
